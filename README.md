# Moneta Terminal

*A weird hybrid between an exchange, a broker, and a Bloomberg terminal. Your all in one simulator.*

MonetaTerminal was born out of necessities. Firstly, the necessity of having a system capable of interacting with
the yet to be designed Moneta-HFT system. A trading system requires an eco-system around it to receive pricing data,
trading ledgers and activity, and an exchange to execute trades. MonetaTerminal aim at doing all of that.
Additionally, it solves another purpouse: that of being able to make mistakes.

No software comes right at first pass, especially one thought, designed, and written by someone new to the world of electronic trading systems.
I know that mistakes will be made. As such, I wanted to have the chance at a first pass before tackling them in a program that is supposed
to showcase a high level of performance.
